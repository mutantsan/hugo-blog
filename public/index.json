This blog is where I share my thoughts, experiments, and notes‚Äîmostly around software development, open source, and the little discoveries I make along the way.\nWhat I Do # I‚Äôm a developer with a focus on building practical tools and exploring ideas that make data, code, and technology more approachable. Some of my interests include:\nSoftware Development ‚Äî from backend systems to frontend interactions. Open Source ‚Äî contributing, learning, and publishing tools others can use. Open Data ‚Äî making data accessible and useful for everyone. Why This Blog # I started this blog as a way to:\nKeep track of what I learn. Share knowledge with others who might face the same challenges. Have a personal space on the web that‚Äôs truly mine. But really, I just wanted to play around with Hugo framework and its themes. Outside of Work # When I‚Äôm not coding or tinkering with projects, you‚Äôll probably find me:\nPlaying video games (especially RPGs and metroidvanias). Reading sci-fi and fantasy novels and manga. Learning new languages (human ones as well as programming). Exploring new ideas and technologies just for fun.
