# Hi, Iâ€™m Oleksandr ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the internet.
This blog is where I share my thoughts, experiments, and notesâ€”mostly around software development, open source, and the little discoveries I make along the way.

## What I Do
Iâ€™m a developer with a focus on building practical tools and exploring ideas that make data, code, and technology more approachable. Some of my interests include:
- **Software development** â€” from backend systems to frontend interactions.
- **Open source** â€” contributing, learning, and publishing tools others can use.
- **Astronomy & science** â€” I enjoy looking up and learning about the universe.

## Why This Blog
I started this blog as a way to:
- Keep track of what I learn.
- Share knowledge with others who might face the same challenges.
- Have a personal space on the web thatâ€™s truly mine.

## Outside of Work
When Iâ€™m not coding or tinkering with projects, youâ€™ll probably find me:
- Reading about astronomy and space exploration.
- Learning new languages (human ones as well as programming).
- Exploring new ideas and technologies just for fun.
