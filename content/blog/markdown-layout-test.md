This post is a playground for testing various features of Hugo and the Blowfish theme.
Iâ€™m using it to verify formatting, layouts, and content elements before I publish regular articles.

---

## Code Snippets

Testing syntax highlighting for different languages.

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Hugo"))
```

```bash
# Hugo version check
hugo version
```

---

## Images

Testing image embedding and captions.

## Lists

Ordered list:

1. Verify headings
2. Test code blocks
3. Insert images
4. Add tables and callouts

Unordered list:

- Syntax highlighting
- Blockquotes
- Tables
- Emojis and icons

## Blockquotes

> Hugo makes it easy to structure content clearly, and Blowfish renders it cleanly.

## Tables

| Feature        | Status   | Notes                        |
|----------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| Headings       | âœ…       | Works as expected             |
| Code blocks    | âœ…       | Multi-language supported      |
| Images         | âœ…       | Inline and block              |
| Lists          | âœ…       | Ordered and unordered         |
| Tables         | âœ…       | Markdown tables render well   |
| Callouts       | âœ…       | Visual styling supported      |

## Callouts

> **ðŸ’¡ Note:** Using callouts is useful to highlight important points or instructions.

---

## Conclusion

This post serves purely to test Hugoâ€™s content capabilities and Blowfishâ€™s rendering.
Everything here is intentionally varied to check how different elements appear and behave.

---

**Next Steps:**

- Experiment with shortcodes (video, tweets, alerts).
- Test pagination, excerpts, and lists on the blog page.
- Refine styling and layout for real articles.
